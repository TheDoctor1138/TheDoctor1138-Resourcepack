TheDoctor's resourcepack V1.2

This is the resourcepack that I use for all my recordings, it contains stuff like:


* A base 64x pack
* Black bricks (because screw blue bricks)
* Transparant(ish) GUI
* Custom Item Textures for in the lobby and in-game
* different font


Changelog
* Added Mason Brick to sword rack
* Removed unused files
* Reworked entire resourcepack
* Fixed 3d models
* Fixed blocks having break particles (They're gone again)
* Fixed held items not being in correct orientation (radiant blade for example)

If you encounter any issues, please PM me on discord TheDoctor#4393
